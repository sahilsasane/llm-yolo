   ```  
3. Configure the Google API Key:  
   - Provide the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in the `.env` file located in the `app` directory.  
   - Use the `.envSample` file as a reference:  
     ```bash
     cp .envSample .env
     ```
     Edit the `.env` file to include your Google API key:  
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
     ```
4. Run the FastAPI server:  
   ```bash
   python main.py

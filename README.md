# Project Overview

This repository contains two independent AI-based projects, each targeting a distinct application area. Each project is structured in its respective folder with detailed documentation and implementation files.

## **Part 1: LLM-Based Sports AI Agent**
An AI agent leveraging large language models (LLMs) to analyze and provide insights from sports data. The system enables users to query CSV or Excel files containing sports statistics or player performance data using natural language, making sports data analysis more intuitive and accessible.

## **Part 2: Computer Vision Road Pothole Detection**
A computer vision system designed to detect potholes in road images or videos. The system processes road footage, identifies potholes, and generates annotated outputs, contributing to road maintenance and safety initiatives.

Refer to the individual folders for detailed documentation, including setup instructions, methodologies, and usage guidelines.
